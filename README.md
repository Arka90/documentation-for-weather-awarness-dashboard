# Environmental Awareness Dashboard

## How to Setup ?
- Step 1: Clone Server Code from https://github.com/Arka90/Environmental-Awareness-Dashboard-server.git
- Step 2: Clone Client Code from https://github.com/Arka90/Environmental-Awareness-Dashboard-Client.git
- Step 3: Open Server Code folder in any terminal and run ``` npm install ``` this will install the dependencies.

Note: Currently for simplicity I am not ignoring the **.env** file in case if you don't have the file create a **.env** file on root level and paste the following content

```
PORT=9000

MONGO_URL=mongodb+srv://arkas:gxmZ5o5Z3sdRyDAs@graphql-todo.uqv1bgd.mongodb.net/environmental_awareness_dashboard

OPEN_WEATHER_API_KEY=eb1e413a47msh01131ac642bf46cp13daf0jsn74162f243860
```

- Step 4: Now to run the server run this command ``` npm run start ```. If every thing went well you will see these message in console "Server is running on port 9000
DB Successfully Connected ðŸŸ¢"  
- Step 5: Now to Start the client go into the client folder and run this command ```npm install``` this will again download all the dependencies for the client
- Step 6: To start the client code run this command ```npm run dev```. You will get a local hosted link for the app click that to open on the browser
